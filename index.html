  <h2>About Me</h2>

    Hello! I'm Soundarya Chellamuthu, a detail-oriented and self-motivated professional with over two years of experience in virtual assistance, corporate training, documentation, and client engagement. With a strong academic foundation in Computer Science, I bring a unique blend of technical knowledge and operational support expertise.

    My professional journey began with Adroit Technologies, where I served as a Corporate Trainer and Client Manager. I led training programs on AI, Cloud, and Business Intelligence tools while managing training documentation, procurement processes, and LMS content. My ability to simplify complex technical topics and maintain structured workflows allowed me to work seamlessly with both engineering and arts institutions.

    Currently, I am working at GetFriday as a Virtual Assistant and Customer Support Executive. I assist international clients with administrative coordination, email communication, schedule and task management, and documentation. I am known for my ability to multitask, adapt quickly to new tools, and provide consistent, reliable remote support.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of work, I have a deep interest in exploring the latest technologies and productivity tools ‚Äî I enjoy discovering new platforms and learning how they can enhance business operations. In my free time, I love playing throwball, reading technology and leadership journals, and staying inspired by creative and professional growth stories.
